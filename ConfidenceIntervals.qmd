**Confidence intervals** estimate unknown population parameters (e.g., a mean $\mu$ or proportion) using sample data. While a **point estimator** like the sample mean $\bar{X}$ provides a single-value estimate, it lacks a measure of reliability. An **interval estimator** (confidence interval) addresses this by producing a range of values with an associated **confidence level** (e.g., 95%). This confidence level reflects the long-run success rate of the method: *if we repeatedly sampled the population and constructed intervals, 95% of those intervals would contain the true parameter*. This "repeated sampling" interpretation emphasizes that the confidence level describes the *method’s reliability*, not the probability that a single interval contains the parameter.

To illustrate, let’s simulate 95% confidence intervals for a population mean $\mu = 50$ using R. We’ll generate 50 samples (each with $n=30$ observations) from a normal distribution, compute their confidence intervals, and visualize results. Plotting these intervals shows most (≈95%) capture $\mu$, while a few miss it – mirroring the confidence level’s meaning. The proportion of intervals containing $\mu$ will typically hover near 0.95, with deviations due to random sampling.

```{webr}
# Simulate repeated sampling and plot CIs
set.seed(123)
true_mean <- 50
cis <- map_df(1:100, ~{
  sample_data <- rnorm(30, true_mean, 10)
  t_test <- t.test(sample_data)
  tibble(
    sample = .x,
    lower = t_test$conf.int[1],
    upper = t_test$conf.int[2],
    estimate = mean(sample_data),
    contains_mu = between(true_mean, lower, upper)
  )
})

ggplot(cis, aes(x = sample, y = estimate, 
                color = contains_mu, ymin = lower, ymax = upper)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = true_mean, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "95% Confidence Intervals from 100 Samples",
       subtitle = paste("Proportion containing μ:", 
                        round(mean(cis$contains_mu), 2))) +
  scale_color_manual(
    name = "Contains μ?",  
    values = c(`TRUE` = "gray30", `FALSE` = "red")  
  )
```

**Key insights**:  

1. A 95% CI does *not* mean "there’s a 95% chance $\mu$ lies in this interval" – $\mu$ is fixed, and the interval either contains it or not.  
2. Coverage depends on assumptions (e.g., normality via CLT for small $n$; less critical for $n \geq 30$).  
3. In practice, you only compute *one* interval, but its reliability is tied to the theoretical behavior of *many* intervals.
