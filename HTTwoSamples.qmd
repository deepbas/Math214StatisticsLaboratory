### **Background: Two-Sample t-Tests**

Two-sample t-tests compare population means using two independent or paired samples.  

1. **Independent t-test**: Compares means of two unrelated groups (e.g., measurements from two sites).  
   - **Assumptions**:  
     - Independence between groups  
     - Normality (or large sample size for CLT)  
     - Homogeneity of variances **not required** (default in R uses Welch’s correction).  

   - **Test Statistic**:  
     $$
     t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}
     $$  
     Degrees of freedom approximated via Welch-Satterthwaite equation.  

2. **Paired t-test**: Compares means of two related groups (e.g., pre/post measurements).  
   - **Assumptions**:  
     - Paired observations  
     - Differences approximately normal  

   - **Test Statistic**:  
     $$
     t = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}
     $$  
     where $\bar{d}$ = mean difference, $s_d$ = standard deviation of differences.

### **Example 1: Independent t-Test**  

Using the built‐in `mtcars` dataset to compare miles per gallon between automatic (0) and manual (1) transmissions.

```{webr}
# Independent t-test using mtcars dataset
data(mtcars)
t.test(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
```


### **Example 2: Paired t-Test**  

Use the built‐in `sleep` dataset to compare extra sleep under two drug treatments.

```{webr}
# Paired t-test using sleep dataset
data(sleep)
drug1 <- sleep[sleep$group == 1, "extra"]
drug2 <- sleep[sleep$group == 2, "extra"]
t.test(drug1, drug2, paired = TRUE)
```
