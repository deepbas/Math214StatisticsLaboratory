# Hypothesis Testing with Small Samples

When dealing with small sample sizes ($n < 30$), classical large-sample results like the Central Limit Theorem may no longer guarantee normality of the sampling distribution. In such cases, it's crucial to:

- Evaluate the normality assumption before applying parametric tests,
- Use robust non-parametric alternatives when appropriate, and
- Interpret results cautiously, understanding the impact of small $n$ on variability and inference.

Below we walk through several demonstrations where these issues come to the fore.

### Example 1: Optical Density and Toxicity Limits

We test whether the **median optical density** of a new batch of formaldehyde exceeds various safety thresholds.

Observed values:

```{webr}
Formaldehyde$optden
```

Using a one-sample **sign test** with median hypothesis $H_0: \text{median} = 0.01$ versus $H_1: \text{median} > 0.01$, we obtain:

```{webr}
library(BSDA)
SIGN.test(Formaldehyde$optden, md = 0.01, alternative = "greater")
```

**Results**:

- All 6 values exceed 0.01 → $s = 6$
- p-value = **0.0156** → Reject $H_0$ at 5% level
- 95% CI for median: **(0.1531, ∞)**  
- Median estimate = **0.492**

Thus, there is statistically significant evidence that the population median optical density exceeds 0.01.

### Example 2: Insect Spray Efficacy

We examine whether **Spray C** reduces insect counts below a target mean of 15:

```{webr}
library(car)
library(nortest)
sprayC <- subset(InsectSprays, spray == "C")$count
qqPlot(sprayC)
ad.test(sprayC)
t.test(sprayC, mu = 15, alternative = "less")
```

**Results**:

- Sample mean = **2.08**
- t-statistic = **–22.65**, df = 11
- 95% upper bound = **3.11**
- p-value ≈ **7.0 × 10⁻¹¹**

Despite minor skewness in the Q-Q plot, the extreme t-statistic and low p-value offer **strong evidence** that the mean count is much lower than 15. Spray C is highly effective.

### Example 3: CO₂ Uptake in Quebec Plants

We test whether the **median CO₂ uptake** differs from 25 μmol/m²:

```{webr}
quebec <- subset(CO2, Type == "Quebec")$uptake
qqPlot(quebec)
shapiro.test(quebec)        # n = 21
wilcox.test(quebec, mu = 25)
```

**Shapiro-Wilk Test**:

- W = **0.86**, p = **0.0001** → Reject normality

**Wilcoxon Test** (nonparametric):

- V = **794.5**, p-value ≈ **1.85 × 10⁻⁵**
- Warning due to ties (non-exact p-value)

There is **strong evidence** that the true median differs from 25. The Wilcoxon test is preferred due to non-normality and ties in the data.

These results show how different inferential techniques adapt to the sample size, normality, and test direction. In each case, statistical output supports a meaningful, interpretable scientific decision.
