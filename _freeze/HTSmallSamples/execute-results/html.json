In such cases, it's crucial to:\n\n- Evaluate the normality assumption before applying parametric tests,\n- Use robust non-parametric alternatives when appropriate, and\n- Interpret results cautiously, understanding the impact of small $n$ on variability and inference.\n\nBelow we walk through several demonstrations where these issues come to the fore.\n\n### Example 1: Optical Density and Toxicity Limits\n\nWe test whether the **median optical density** of a new batch of formaldehyde exceeds various safety thresholds.\n\nObserved values:\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\nFormaldehyde$optden\n```\n:::\n\nUsing a one-sample **sign test** with median hypothesis $H_0: \\text{median} = 0.01$ versus $H_1: \\text{median} > 0.01$, we obtain:\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\nlibrary(BSDA)\nSIGN.test(Formaldehyde$optden, md = 0.01, alternative = \"greater\")\n```\n:::\n\n**Results**:\n\n- All 6 values exceed 0.01 → $s = 6$\n- p-value = **0.0156** → Reject $H_0$ at 5% level\n- 95% CI for median: **(0.1531, ∞)**  \n- Median estimate = **0.492**\n\nThus, there is statistically significant evidence that the population median optical density exceeds 0.01.\n\n---\n\n### Example 2: Insect Spray Efficacy\n\nWe examine whether **Spray C** reduces insect counts below a target mean of 15:\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(nortest)\nsprayC <- subset(InsectSprays, spray == \"C\")$count\nqqPlot(sprayC)\nad.test(sprayC)\nt.test(sprayC, mu = 15, alternative = \"less\")\n```\n:::\n\n**Results**:\n\n- Sample mean = **2.08**\n- t-statistic = **–22.65**, df = 11\n- 95% upper bound = **3.11**\n- p-value ≈ **7.0 × 10⁻¹¹**\n\nDespite minor skewness in the Q-Q plot, the extreme t-statistic and low p-value offer **strong evidence** that the mean count is much lower than 15. Spray C is highly effective.\n\n---\n\n### Example 3: CO₂ Uptake in Quebec Plants\n\nWe test whether the **median CO₂ uptake** differs from 25 μmol/m²:\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\nquebec <- subset(CO2, Type == \"Quebec\")$uptake\nqqPlot(quebec)\nshapiro.test(quebec)        # n = 21\nwilcox.test(quebec, mu = 25)\n```\n:::\n\n**Shapiro-Wilk Test**:\n\n- W = **0.86**, p = **0.0001** → Reject normality\n\n**Wilcoxon Test** (nonparametric):\n\n- V = **794.5**, p-value ≈ **1.85 × 10⁻⁵**\n- Warning due to ties (non-exact p-value)\n\nThere is **strong evidence** that the true median differs from 25. The Wilcoxon test is preferred due to non-normality and ties in the data.\n\n--- \n\nThese results show how different inferential techniques adapt to the sample size, normality, and test direction. In each case, statistical output supports a meaningful, interpretable scientific decision.",
