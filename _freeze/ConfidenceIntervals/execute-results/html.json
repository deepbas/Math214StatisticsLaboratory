While a **point estimator** like the sample mean $\\bar{X}$ provides a single-value estimate, it lacks a measure of reliability. An **interval estimator** (confidence interval) addresses this by producing a range of values with an associated **confidence level** (e.g., 95%). This confidence level reflects the long-run success rate of the method: *if we repeatedly sampled the population and constructed intervals, 95% of those intervals would contain the true parameter*. This \"repeated sampling\" interpretation emphasizes that the confidence level describes the *method’s reliability*, not the probability that a single interval contains the parameter.\n\nTo illustrate, let’s simulate 95% confidence intervals for a population mean $\\mu = 50$ using R. We’ll generate 50 samples (each with $n=30$ observations) from a normal distribution, compute their confidence intervals, and visualize results. Plotting these intervals shows most (≈95%) capture $\\mu$, while a few miss it – mirroring the confidence level’s meaning. The proportion of intervals containing $\\mu$ will typically hover near 0.95, with deviations due to random sampling.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ConfidenceIntervals_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n**Key insights**:  \n\n1. A 95% CI does *not* mean \"there’s a 95% chance $\\mu$ lies in this interval\" – $\\mu$ is fixed, and the interval either contains it or not.  \n2. Coverage depends on assumptions (e.g., normality via CLT for small $n$; less critical for $n \\geq 30$).  \n3. In practice, you only compute *one* interval, but its reliability is tied to the theoretical behavior of *many* intervals.  \n",
