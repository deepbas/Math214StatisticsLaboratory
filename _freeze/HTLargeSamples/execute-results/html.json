This allows the use of $t$-tests even when the underlying population distribution is unknown. A well-defined 8-step framework aids in systematically evaluating hypotheses, balancing statistical rigor with practical decision-making.\n\n\n\n## Motivating Case: Public Health Crisis Response\n\nConsider a public health application involving NYC’s historical temperature data. Using the `airquality` dataset (n = 153), we test whether the mean temperature exceeds 77°F. The one-sided $t$-test returns a test statistic of $t = 1.1531$ and a p-value of 0.1253. Since this p-value exceeds the typical $\\alpha = 0.05$ threshold, we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis. Despite the observed mean being $77.88^\\circ$F, the evidence is insufficient to conclude that temperatures are significantly above 77°F. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\ndata(airquality)\nt.test(airquality$Temp, mu = 77, alternative = \"greater\", conf.level = 0.95)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Poultry Farming (ChickWeight)\n\nIn contrast, consider the `ChickWeight` dataset where we examine whether chicks on Diet 1 have a mean weight different from 100g. With n = 220, a two-sided $t$-test yields $t = 0.6926$ and a p-value of 0.4893. The observed mean weight is 102.65g, but again the large p-value indicates **no significant difference** from the hypothesized mean. The 95% confidence interval (95.12g, 110.17g) includes 100g, reinforcing that any deviation could easily be due to sampling variability.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\ndiet1 <- subset(ChickWeight, Diet == 1)$weight\nt.test(diet1, mu = 100, alternative = \"two.sided\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThese examples highlight that even with large samples, statistical significance depends on both effect size and variability—not merely sample size. Proper interpretation ensures sound, data-driven decisions.\n\n",
