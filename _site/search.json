    "text": "Confidence intervals estimate unknown population parameters (e.g., a mean \\(\\mu\\) or proportion) using sample data. While a point estimator like the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) provides a single-value estimate, it lacks a measure of reliability. An interval estimator (confidence interval) addresses this by producing a range of values with an associated confidence level (e.g., 95%). This confidence level reflects the long-run success rate of the method: if we repeatedly sampled the population and constructed intervals, 95% of those intervals would contain the true parameter. This “repeated sampling” interpretation emphasizes that the confidence level describes the method’s reliability, not the probability that a single interval contains the parameter.\nTo illustrate, let’s simulate 95% confidence intervals for a population mean \\(\\mu = 50\\) using R. We’ll generate 50 samples (each with \\(n=30\\) observations) from a normal distribution, compute their confidence intervals, and visualize results. Plotting these intervals shows most (≈95%) capture \\(\\mu\\), while a few miss it – mirroring the confidence level’s meaning. The proportion of intervals containing \\(\\mu\\) will typically hover near 0.95, with deviations due to random sampling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey insights:\n\nA 95% CI does not mean “there’s a 95% chance \\(\\mu\\) lies in this interval” – \\(\\mu\\) is fixed, and the interval either contains it or not.\n\nCoverage depends on assumptions (e.g., normality via CLT for small \\(n\\); less critical for \\(n \\geq 30\\)).\n\nIn practice, you only compute one interval, but its reliability is tied to the theoretical behavior of many intervals.",

    "text": "Hypothesis Testing with Small Samples\nWhen dealing with small sample sizes (\\(n &lt; 30\\)), classical large-sample results like the Central Limit Theorem may no longer guarantee normality of the sampling distribution. In such cases, it’s crucial to:\n\nEvaluate the normality assumption before applying parametric tests,\nUse robust non-parametric alternatives when appropriate, and\nInterpret results cautiously, understanding the impact of small \\(n\\) on variability and inference.\n\nBelow we walk through several demonstrations where these issues come to the fore.\n\nExample 1: Optical Density and Toxicity Limits\nWe test whether the median optical density of a new batch of formaldehyde exceeds various safety thresholds.\nObserved values:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a one-sample sign test with median hypothesis \\(H_0: \\text{median} = 0.01\\) versus \\(H_1: \\text{median} &gt; 0.01\\), we obtain:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nAll 6 values exceed 0.01 → \\(s = 6\\)\np-value = 0.0156 → Reject \\(H_0\\) at 5% level\n95% CI for median: (0.1531, ∞)\n\nMedian estimate = 0.492\n\nThus, there is statistically significant evidence that the population median optical density exceeds 0.01.\n\n\n\nExample 2: Insect Spray Efficacy\nWe examine whether Spray C reduces insect counts below a target mean of 15:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nSample mean = 2.08\nt-statistic = –22.65, df = 11\n95% upper bound = 3.11\np-value ≈ 7.0 × 10⁻¹¹\n\nDespite minor skewness in the Q-Q plot, the extreme t-statistic and low p-value offer strong evidence that the mean count is much lower than 15. Spray C is highly effective.\n\n\n\nExample 3: CO₂ Uptake in Quebec Plants\nWe test whether the median CO₂ uptake differs from 25 μmol/m²:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShapiro-Wilk Test:\n\nW = 0.86, p = 0.0001 → Reject normality\n\nWilcoxon Test (nonparametric):\n\nV = 794.5, p-value ≈ 1.85 × 10⁻⁵\nWarning due to ties (non-exact p-value)\n\nThere is strong evidence that the true median differs from 25. The Wilcoxon test is preferred due to non-normality and ties in the data.\n\nThese results show how different inferential techniques adapt to the sample size, normality, and test direction. In each case, statistical output supports a meaningful, interpretable scientific decision."

    "text": "Discrete Random Variables\nA random variable, typically denoted by \\(X\\), is a variable that takes on a numerical value determined by chance for each outcome of an experiment. A probability distribution provides the probability for each possible value of \\(X\\), often presented in a table, formula, or graph.\nExample: Suppose you flip a coin. If it lands on tails, you win $1; if it lands on heads, you win $0. Here, the random variable \\(X\\) has two values: 1 and 0. Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability distribution is:\n\n\n\n\\(X\\)\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\n\\(P(X=x)\\)\n\\(1/2\\)\n\\(1/2\\)\n\n\n\nThis represents a discrete random variable, where the set of possible values is finite or countably infinite (e.g., the number of coin tosses before the first tail).",
