Here’s how you can use different Markdown syntax to format text within your R Markdown documents.\nHeaders\nCreate headers by prefixing the text with one or more hash symbols (#). The number of # symbols before the text determines the level of the header.\n# Header 1\n## Header 2\n### Header 3\nLists\nYou can create bulleted or numbered lists:\n\n\nUnordered Lists (bullets):\n\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n  - Subitem 1\n  - Subitem 2\n\n\nOrdered Lists:\n\n1.

This can be done in several ways:\n\n\nUsing RStudio:\n\nIn RStudio, you can set the working directory through the menu by navigating to Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Directory... and selecting your math216 folder.\n\n\n\nUsing R Script:\n\nYou can also set the working directory directly in an R script using the setwd() function. Place the following line of code at the beginning of your script:\n\nsetwd(\"~/math216\")\nReplace \"~/math216\" with the actual path to your course folder.\n\n\nUsing R Console:\n\nYou can manually set the working directory in the R console with the same command:\n\nsetwd(\"~/math216\")"
