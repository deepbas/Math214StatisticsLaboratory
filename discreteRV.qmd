In the next three lab assignments, students will review the concept of a random variable and its probability distribution. They will learn how to determine key parameters such as mean, variance, and standard deviation, and compute probabilities for different outcomes.

## Discrete Random Variables

A random variable, typically denoted by $X$, is a variable that takes on a numerical value determined by chance for each outcome of an experiment. A probability distribution provides the probability for each possible value of $X$, often presented in a table, formula, or graph.

*Example*: Suppose you flip a coin. If it lands on tails, you win \$1; if it lands on heads, you win \$0. Here, the random variable $X$ has two values: 1 and 0. Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability distribution is:

| $X$ | 0   | 1   |
|-----|-----|-----|
| $P(X=x)$ | $1/2$ | $1/2$ |

This represents a discrete random variable, where the set of possible values is finite or countably infinite (e.g., the number of coin tosses before the first tail).

## Parameters of a Probability Distribution

### Mean (Expected Value)

The mean is the central, weighted average value of the random variable. It is computed as:

$$
\begin{align}
\mu = E[X] = \sum x \cdot P(X=x)
\end{align}
$$

### Variance and Standard Deviation

Variance measures the spread or dispersion of the random variable around the mean. It can be calculated using:

$$
\begin{align}
\sigma^2 = \sum \left[(x-\mu)^2 \cdot P(X=x)\right]
\end{align}
$$

Alternatively, for manual computation, the variance may be expressed as:

$$
\begin{align}
\sigma^2 = \sum \left[x^2 \cdot P(X=x)\right] - \mu^2
\end{align}
$$

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
