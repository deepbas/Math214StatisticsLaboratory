A continuous random variable can take infinitely many values, and its outcomes cannot be counted individually. Instead of listing outcomes, we describe its behavior using a probability density function (pdf) where the area under the curve represents probabilities.

## Density Curves

A density curve must satisfy:
1. The total area under the curve equals 1.
2. Every point on the curve has a non-negative height (i.e., the curve does not fall below the $x$-axis).

## Common Continuous Distributions

### Uniform Distribution

A continuous random variable has a uniform distribution if its values are evenly spread over the interval $[a,b]$. Its density function is given by:

$$
\begin{align}
f(x)=\frac{1}{b-a},\quad \text{for } a\le x\le b
\end{align}
$$

The mean and standard deviation are:

$$
\begin{align}
\mu &= \frac{a+b}{2},\\[1em]
\sigma &= \frac{b-a}{\sqrt{12}}
\end{align}
$$

### Normal Distribution

The normal distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, described by the equation:

$$
\begin{align}
f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
\end{align}
$$

Here, $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. A special case with $\mu=0$ and $\sigma=1$ is called the standard normal distribution.

### Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution, often referred to as the waiting-time distribution, has the density function:

$$
\begin{align}
f(x)=\frac{1}{\theta} \exp\left(-\frac{x}{\theta}\right),\quad \text{for } x\ge0
\end{align}
$$

In this case, both the mean and the standard deviation are equal to $\theta$:

$$
\begin{align}
\mu &= \theta,\\[1em]
\sigma &= \theta
\end{align}
$$
